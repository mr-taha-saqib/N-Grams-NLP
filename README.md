# N-Gram Analysis

## Objectives  
1. Tokenize pre-processed email text data.  
2. Extract and analyze bigrams, trigrams, and n-grams.  
3. Calculate and interpret the frequency of n-grams.  
4. Explore advanced n-gram analysis techniques.  

## Pre-Lab Preparation  
- Ensure the `emails.csv` file is available and can be read into a Python environment.  
- Review tokenization and its importance in text analysis.

## Lab Tasks  

### Task 1: Tokenization  
- Tokenize the email text data into words.  

### Task 2: Bigram Analysis  
- Extract bigrams from the tokenized data.  
- Calculate the frequency of each bigram.  
- Identify the top 10 most common bigrams.  

### Task 3: Trigram Analysis  
- Perform trigram extraction.  
- Determine the frequency of each trigram.  
- List the top 10 most common trigrams.  

### Task 4: N-gram Extraction and Frequency Analysis  
- Create a function to extract n-grams where `n` is a parameter.  
- Analyze the frequency distribution of n-grams for different values of `n`.  

### Task 5: Conditional Frequency Analysis  
- Calculate conditional frequencies, e.g., the frequency of a word given the preceding word(s).  
- Explore what commonly follows a particular word or bigram.  

### Task 6: N-gram Probability Estimation  
- Estimate the probabilities of n-grams within the corpus.  
- Discuss what these probabilities indicate about the dataset.  

### Task 7: Visualization  
- Visualize the frequency distribution of the top n-grams.  
- Create visual comparisons between bigram, trigram, and other n-gram frequencies.  

### Task 8: Long-Tail Analysis  
- Plot the frequency distribution of n-grams on a log-log graph to identify a long-tail distribution.  

### Task 9: Collocation Analysis  
- Identify collocations (word pairs or n-grams that occur together more often than would be expected by chance).
